  <h2 id="membership-heading">How to Become a Member</h2>

  <p>
    Becoming a member of the Florida Statewide Chapter is a simple and straightforward process. But first, what does being a member mean?
  </p>

  <p>
    Being a member of a chapter is the primary way to become a member of the 
    <strong>National Federation of the Blind (NFB)</strong> — the largest and most transformative 
    organization of blind people, led by blind people. The mission of the Federation is to achieve 
    equality, opportunity, and security for the blind, because we believe that blind people can live the lives they want.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, becoming a member of the Florida Statewide Chapter also makes you a member of the 
    <strong>National Federation of the Blind of Florida</strong>. Just like the national organization, 
    the NFB of Florida advocates for equality, opportunity, and security for the blind in our state.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a member of the Florida Statewide Chapter, you can vote on all matters and make motions to help 
    the chapter grow. You’ll join a community of blind people, build friendships and networks, and 
    have opportunities to attend conferences, seminars, and other events. In some cases, the chapter 
    can provide financial assistance to attend these events. You’ll also take part in advocacy — both 
    in Florida and nationally — on issues that affect blind people.
  </p>

  <h3>Advocacy Examples</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Preventing the merger of the Division of Blind Services and the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation into the Agency for Persons with Disabilities.</li>
    <li>Fighting legislation that would have blocked wage increases approved by Florida voters in 2020.</li>
    <li>Advocating nationally for clear standards on accessible websites and software, and for accessibility requirements in new medical devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Guest Speakers</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond advocacy, our chapter regularly hosts guest speakers who present on blindness-related topics 
    and community resources that may benefit our members.
  </p>

  <h3>Membership Process</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Membership cycle:</strong> Our membership year runs from January 1 to December 31.  
      <ul>
        <li>You can pay dues at any time during the year.</li>
        <li>If you pay <strong>between October 1 and February 1</strong>, your dues apply to the <em>new membership cycle</em>.</li>
        <li>If you pay <strong>during February</strong>, your membership begins in March and continues through December 31.</li>
        <li>If you pay <strong>between March and October</strong>, your membership is active through December 31 of the same year.</li>
        <li>If you pay <strong>very late in the cycle</strong> (close to October), the board may decide to grandfather your dues into the next year.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fill out the membership form:</strong> Complete our membership form 
      (<a href="#membership">available here</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pay your dues:</strong>  
      You may pay via:
      <ul>
        <li>Zelle: <code>nfbf.statewide@gmail.com</code> (note: write “YourName Statewide Dues” in the memo)</li>
        <li>PayPal: <a href="https://paypal.me/nfbf" target="_blank">paypal.me/nfbf</a>  
            (no account required, enter “YourName Statewide Chapter Dues” in the memo field)</li>
      </ul>
      Dues are vital to our treasury, allowing us to assist members in attending events and to support chapter initiatives.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Attend meetings:</strong> After paying dues, attend two meetings to get to know the chapter.  
      At your third meeting, you will participate in a <em>membership ceremony</em>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>The Membership Ceremony</h3>
  <p>
    The ceremony is a symbolic way of welcoming new members. You will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduce yourself and answer a fun icebreaker question.</li>
    <li>Hear the meaning of membership in the Federation read aloud.</li>
    <li>Recite the Federation pledge with our chapter president.</li>
    <li>Be asked if you accept membership. The chapter then votes to approve your membership.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What Happens Next</h3>
  <p>
    After you pay dues, our membership coordinator enters your information into the 
    <strong>National Federation of the Blind Membership Portal</strong> for official records.  
    You will also receive:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A certificate of membership.</li>
    <li>A membership coin — a symbol of belonging in the Federation.  
      The coin features the word “Together” in Braille on one side, with “Member” printed beneath, 
      and the NFB logo on the reverse.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Active vs. Inactive Membership</h3>
  <p>
    You are considered an <strong>inactive member</strong> if you do not pay dues for two years.  
    If you miss one year, you remain a member but are not a dues-paying member.  
    Only dues-paying members may vote, make motions, or receive financial assistance for events.
  </p>

  <h3>Who Can Join?</h3>
  <p>
    You do not need to be blind to join our chapter. We welcome sighted members who share our mission 
    and want to support the work of the National Federation of the Blind.
