  <p>
    The mailing lists, commonly referred to as <strong>listserves</strong>, are the primary way of communicating in the 
    National Federation of the Blind of Florida and the Florida Statewide Chapter. In the Florida Statewide Chapter, we use two different listserves:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Florida Statewide Chapter Listserve</strong> — available to members of the chapter. 
      This listserve is moderated.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>National Federation of the Blind of Florida Internet Mailing List Listserve</strong> — 
      available to all NFB of Florida members regardless of chapter. 
      This listserve is unmoderated and open.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The subscription forms for both mailing lists are provided below. 
    You can switch between the two forms by clicking the appropriate <strong>tab button</strong> above the forms.  
    If you prefer to visit the subscription page directly, a link is also provided within each tab’s description.
  </p>

  <h3>How to Subscribe</h3>
