  <p>
    The mailing lists, commonly referred to as <strong>listserves</strong>, are the primary way of communicating in the 
    National Federation of the Blind of Florida and the Florida Statewide Chapter. In the Florida Statewide Chapter, we use two different listserves:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Florida Statewide Chapter Listserve</strong> — available to members of the chapter. 
      This listserve is moderated.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>National Federation of the Blind of Florida Internet Mailing List Listserve</strong> — 
      available to all NFB of Florida members regardless of chapter. 
      This listserve is unmoderated and open.
    </li>
  </ul>
