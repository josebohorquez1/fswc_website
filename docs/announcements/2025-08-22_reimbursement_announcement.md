Hello Statewide Advocates,

The Statewide Chapter Board is proud to announce our Convention Registration Reimbursement Initiative. This program is designed to help offset the cost of attending convention while encouraging members to contribute to the success of our chapter.

Members who complete the steps below will receive a reimbursement from the Statewide Chapter to cover the cost of their convention registration. You must be a member of the Florida Statewide Chapter to participate in this initiative.

# **Step 1: Complete the Reimbursement Form**

The form will collect your basic information and ideas to strengthen our chapter. You will be asked to provide:

* Email  
* First Name  
* Last Name  
* Phone Number  
* Five fundraising ideas for the Florida Statewide Chapter  
* Five guest speaker topics or speakers you would like to see at future meetings

# **Step 2: Volunteer at Convention**

To qualify, each participant must:

1. Volunteer for one shift at the Statewide Chapter exhibit hall table  
2. Volunteer for one shift in the hospitality suite

4. Deadline: October 1st

# **Why These Requirements?**

* Exhibit Hall Table: This year’s fundraiser will help us support members attending future conferences, seminars, and NFB events such as Tallahassee Days.  
* Hospitality Suite: As one of the hosting chapters, we are responsible for helping run the suite. Member participation is essential to its success.

# **Questions?**

If you need assistance with the form or have any questions, please email [statewide@nfbflorida.org](mailto:statewide@nfbflorida.org). I’ll be glad to help.

We look forward to seeing you at the state convention. Thank you for supporting our chapter, and have a wonderful day\!
