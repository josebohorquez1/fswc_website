<p>Hello Florida,</p> 

<p>
Convention is a place where we can network, learn, and grow together. One of the highlights of convention is the hospitality suite, a welcoming space where attendees can grab a snack, enjoy a refreshing beverage, and connect with friends. But the suite can’t run by itself, and it certainly can’t run with just one or two people.
That’s why we need you. Volunteers make the hospitality suite possible. By helping out, you’ll ensure that all guests, including yourself, can enjoy snacks and drinks in an organized, friendly environment.
</p>

<h3>What Does Volunteering Involve?</h3>
<p>Volunteering in the hospitality suite is a fun and rewarding experience. Shifts are generally two hours long, though a few are slightly shorter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Morning shifts: 1 hour 45 minutes</li>
  <li>Saturday evening: 1 hour 30 minutes</li>
  <li>Sunday closing shift: 1 hour</li>
  <li>
    Duties include:
    <ul>
      <li>Distributing snacks and beverages</li>
      <li>Making coffee for guests</li>
      <li>Greeting guests and maintaining an orderly line</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteering is more than just completing tasks; you’ll meet new people, enjoy conversations, and help create a welcoming atmosphere. The best part is seeing guests leave happy thanks to your service.</p>

<h3>How to Volunteer</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Check the agenda (when it’s released) and decide when you’re available.</li>
  <li>
    Fill out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx1qGxQCMWD7wTYS9h1CkI75DSTWTB7c8AI7WaycxVitoZdg/viewform?usp=header">Google Form</a>. 
    The form lets you:
    <ul>
      <li>See available shifts and remaining spots</li>
      <li>Choose your preferred shifts</li>
      <li>Enter your contact information</li>
      <li>Add any notes (e.g., running late, needing to leave early, etc.)</li>
      <li>
        Note about submission: When clicking the submit button, you may be met with a captcha. This is because there is a script that runs every time the form is submitted to update availability. To complete the captcha:
        <ul>
          <li>If you have remaining vision, complete it by selecting the correct images.</li>
          <li>If using a screen reader, use the audio challenge. Click “play,” listen, and type what you hear. You don’t need to be 100% accurate.</li>
          <li>The captcha prevents bots from overloading Google’s servers with submissions.</li>
          <li>If you need help with the form, you may text or email me.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Confirm your shifts. After submission, Google will email you your responses. If something is wrong, simply edit your response using the edit link in the confirmation page or email. If you lose it, contact me.</li>
  <li>Before convention: You’ll receive an automated reminder email with your assigned shifts. During convention, the coordinators or I may text you reminders. Please arrive 15 minutes early for your shift so we can review setup and ensure smooth transitions.</li>
  <li>Deadline: Please sign up by October 1st at 11:59 PM.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Manual Additions and Cancellations</h3>
<p>If you cannot use the Google Form, you may contact me by email or text to be added manually. However, please note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manually added volunteers cannot edit their own responses.</li>
  <li>If you need to completely back out of your shifts, you must email or text me so I can update the schedule.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Need Help?</h3>
<p>If you have any issues with the Google Form, you can email me at <a href="mailto:statewide@nfbflorida.org">statewide@nfbflorida.org</a> or contact me at 407-780-3727. Please text first if you’re using my phone number, since I’m often in class.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering this opportunity. Your time and effort mean so much to us and to everyone who enjoys the hospitality suite. We simply couldn’t run it without you.</p>

<p>If you have questions, email or text me and I’ll get back to you within 24 hours (usually sooner). Please share this email with your chapters and divisions.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br>Jose</p>
