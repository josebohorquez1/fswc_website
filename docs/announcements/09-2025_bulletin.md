# **Volunteer at the Hospitality Suite**

One of the biggest parts of convention is the hospitality suite, and we need all the help we can get. The hospitality suite is the place where guests can get lite refreshments and have the opportunity to socialize and connect with other guests. We need help in running the suite. Volunteers will be asked to help in distributing snacks, distributing beverages, and help running the coffee machine. Wish to volunteer?
