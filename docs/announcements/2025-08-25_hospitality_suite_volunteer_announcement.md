Hello Florida,

Convention is a place where we can network, learn, and grow together. One of the highlights of convention is the hospitality suite, a welcoming space where attendees can grab a snack, enjoy a refreshing beverage, and connect with friends. But the suite can’t run by itself, and it certainly can’t run with just one or two people.

That’s why we need you. Volunteers make the hospitality suite possible. By helping out, you’ll ensure that all guests, including yourself, can enjoy snacks and drinks in an organized, friendly environment.

# **What Does Volunteering Involve?**

Shifts are generally two hours long, though a few are slightly shorter:

* Morning shifts: 1 hour 45 minutes  
* Saturday evening: 1 hour 30 minutes  
* Sunday closing shift: 1 hour  
* Duties include:  
  * Distributing snacks and beverages  
  * Making coffee for guests  
  * Greeting guests and maintaining an orderly line

Volunteering is more than just completing tasks; you’ll meet new people, enjoy conversations, and help create a welcoming atmosphere. The best part is seeing guests leave happy thanks to your service.

# **How to Volunteer**

1. Check the agenda (when it’s released) and decide when you’re available.  
2. Fill out our [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx1qGxQCMWD7wTYS9h1CkI75DSTWTB7c8AI7WaycxVitoZdg/viewform?usp=header). The form lets you:  
* See available shifts and remaining spots  
* Choose your preferred shifts  
* Enter your contact information   
* Add any notes (e.g., running late, needing to leave early, etc.)  
* Note about submission: When clicking the submit button, you may be met with a captcha. This is because there is a script, a piece of code, that runs every time the form is submitted to update the form description with volunteer availability and to update the list of shift options. Because of this, Google will ask you to complete the captcha to make sure you are not human. To complete the Captcha, do the following.  
  * If you have remaining vision, complete the Captcha by selecting the correct images.  
  * If using a screen reader, you can click on the audio challenge button. Click “press play to listen” and enter what you here in the text box below the play button. You don’t have to be 100% accurate.  
  * The captcha comes up to make sure that a bot or web scraper is not filling out the form, like a thousand times a second, because if that does happen, the script will run a thousand times and will overwhelm the Google servers.  
  * If you need help with the form, you may text or email me.  
3. Confirm your shifts. After submission, Google will email you your responses. If something is wrong, simply edit your response. The link to edit your response can be found upon submission in the confirmation page or in the confirmation email. The edit response link is specific to you if you close out the confirmation page, or lose the confirmation email, you will have to contact me to edit your response. You can also revisit the form to check which shifts are still open or to see who you’ll be volunteering with.  
4. Before convention: You’ll receive an automated reminder email with your assigned shifts. During convention, the coordinators or I may text you reminders. Please arrive 15 minutes early for your shift so we can review setup, snack and beverage procedures, open the suite promptly for first shift volunteers, and ensure smooth transitions between volunteers.  
5. Deadline: Please sign up by October 1st at 11:59 PM.

# **Manual Additions and Cancellations**

If you cannot use the Google Form, you may contact me by email or text to be added manually. However, please note:

* Manually added volunteers cannot edit their own responses.  
* If you need to completely back out of all your shifts, you must email or text me so I can update the schedule for you since you cannot delete your own response.

# **Need Help?**

If you have any issues with the Google Form, you can email me at [statewide@nfbflorida.org](http://statewide@nfbflorida.org)

 or contact me at [407-780-3727](tel:407-780-3727). Please text first if you’re using my phone number; I’m in class most of the day during the week and may not be able to answer calls right away.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. Your time and effort mean so much to us and to everyone who enjoys the hospitality suite. We simply couldn’t run it without you.

If you have questions, email or text me and I’ll get back to you within 24 hours (usually sooner). Please share this email with your chapters and divisions.

Best regards,

Jose
