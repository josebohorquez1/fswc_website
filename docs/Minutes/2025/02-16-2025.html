<p>8:34 PM Legislative Alerts</p>
<p>• Texas v. Becerra case that has been brought by seventeen states’
attorney generals.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These seventeen states (Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia) have sued
the federal government regarding updated rules which add “gender
dysphoria” to the federal definition of “disability” under Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities
Act.</p></li>
<li><p>As a result, these states have charged that this addition to the
regulations renders Section 504 unconstitutional. As a reminder, Section
504 requires that entities which receive federal funding, like schools
and hospitals, cannot discriminate on the basis of disability.</p></li>
<li><p>We will be receiving a template soon to email to our attorney
generals to fight back against this.</p></li>
<li><p>Blind Americans Return to Work Act has been introduced to the
house!</p></li>
<li><p>HR-1175</p></li>

and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p>Belief Statement</p>
<p>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or

low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams.
Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the
aspirations of all blind people.</p>
