# Florida Statewide Monthly Business Meeting Minutes

## Date: 06/21/2025

# **Quick Minutes Formatting Announcement**

	The minutes will now be formatted using heading levels. This will allow for better accessibility. Screen readers users will be able to use the heading level shortcut keys when viewing the email on any device. For example, if using Jaws or NVDA, you can use the 1 key to move by heading level 1 or the 2-6 keys to move between the other heading levels 2-6. For IOS devices, you can use the headings router to move between the different headings. In addition, I will now be adding meeting summaries for a quick and easy way to digest the meeting.

# **Meeting Summary**

	Our Statewide Monthly Business meeting featured officer updates, guest presentations, planning for upcoming events, and several proposed fundraisers. The meeting began with roll call and a round of personal spotlights from members. Treasurer and Secretary reports were presented and approved.

	A major highlight was a presentation from Sean Welker of Visual Eyes Access, a visual interpreting service offering affordable and trained support for blind individuals, especially for tasks like job applications, accessibility consulting, and real-time navigation. His services emphasize blind-first decision-making, trained interpreters, and flexible billing with rollover minutes.

	Several fundraisers were introduced and discussed for the upcoming Florida State Convention:

1. 50/50 Raffle – $1 per ticket, with a winner drawn at the banquet.  
2. Guess the Candy Jar – $1 per guess; participants estimate the number of candies in a jar. Fundraiser will stop after someone guesses the correct number.  
3. Lemonade Stand was originally proposed as a flavored lemonade bar, but concerns about hotel food restrictions and logistics may shift this to pre-packaged flavored water bottles.  
4. City Pop Fundraiser : A snack fundraiser (popcorn, cotton candy, pretzels) running online that we are considering to launch on June 23 as a pilot fundraiser, offering a 50% profit share. This is meant as a longer-term, repeatable option.

	We also discussed registration fee reimbursements for members attending the state convention. These reimbursements will now include an activity requirement based on meeting attendance and optional “filler” assignments (e.g., submitting ideas for guest speakers or fundraising).

	Lastly, we explored options for the statewide social event at convention, weighing the pros and cons of an off-site Olive Garden dinner versus an in-hotel catered gathering. A final vote will be held in a future meeting.

	The meeting closed with updates on the upcoming National Convention (July 8–13), including Florida Caucus details (July 11 from 8:00 PM – 9:30 PM in Salon C), and a note that the next statewide meeting will tentatively be held on July 20, 2025\.
