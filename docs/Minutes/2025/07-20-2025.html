<h1 class="title">Florida Statewide Chapter Monthly Business Meeting
Minutes</h1>
</header>
<p>Date: 07/20/2025</p>
<h1 id="meeting-summary"><strong>Meeting Summary</strong></h1>
<p>The Florida Statewide Chapter held its monthly business meeting on
July 20, 2025. After opening with the NFB pledge and belief statement,
members shared reflections on the recent national convention in New
Orleans, including both in-person and virtual experiences. The chapter
discussed the ongoing City Pop fundraiser, which has raised over $200
and continues until August 5, and planned additional fundraisers for the
upcoming state convention, including a 50/50 raffle, candy jar guessing
game, and a potential lemonade sale. Sheri Brunn was voted in as a new
member after sharing about her career, family, and long-standing
involvement with the NFB. A significant portion of the meeting focused
on preparations for the 2025 Florida State Convention, which will be
held October 3–5 at the Hilton Altamonte Springs. Members were reminded
that rooms are available and can be booked through the dates of October
2–7 at the convention rate of $139 per night plus tax and a $3 tourism
fee per night, with a reservation deadline of September 3. Registration
for the state convention is $25, and banquet tickets are $75, with meal
options including chicken, beef, or vegetarian. Resources such as a
transportation guide are already available, with a restaurant guide
forthcoming. A sponsorship application for members seeking financial
assistance to attend will be released soon. Members also discussed
hosting a chapter social during the convention, settling on a casual
pizza gathering, with potential locations being the hospitality suite, a
private room, or the hotel</p>
<p>pool area; final arrangements to be determined after a site visit
later in July. The meeting concluded at 9:13 PM.</p>

<h1 id="pm-statewide-social-at-state-convention"><strong>8:56 PM
Statewide Social at State Convention</strong></h1>
<p>We discussed several options for the Statewide social at the state
convention. It was clear that the membership wanted to have a hotel
social. We then discussed several options for what we could do at the
social, and it was discussed to have Pizza as our food option. We then
talked about where we can have the social. Some of the options included
in the sleeping area of the hospitality suite, and a person’s room. If
we were to use a person’s room, we would meet at the agenda-published
social location, then decide on the room. Finally, the idea of having a
pool-side social was discussed. The members visiting the hotel at the
end of July will explore that possibility. All in all, we will have a
social with pizza, and the true location of the social is to be
determined.</p>

<h1 id="pledge"><strong>Pledge</strong></h1>
<p>I pledge to participate actively in the effort of the National
Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security
for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation;
and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<h1 id="belief-statement"><strong>Belief Statement</strong></h1>
<p><u>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you
or our future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people,
because low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our
dreams. Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the
aspirations of all blind people.</u></p>
