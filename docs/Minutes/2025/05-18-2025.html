Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security
for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation;
and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Belief Statement</strong></p>
<p>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or

aspirations of all blind people.</p>
