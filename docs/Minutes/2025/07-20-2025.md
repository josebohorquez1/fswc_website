Date: 07/20/2025

# **Meeting Summary**

	The Florida Statewide Chapter held its monthly business meeting on July 20, 2025\. After opening with the NFB pledge and belief statement, members shared reflections on the recent national convention in New Orleans, including both in-person and virtual experiences. The chapter discussed the ongoing City Pop fundraiser, which has raised over $200 and continues until August 5, and planned additional fundraisers for the upcoming state convention, including a 50/50 raffle, candy jar guessing game, and a potential lemonade sale. Sheri Brunn was voted in as a new member after sharing about her career, family, and long-standing involvement with the NFB. A significant portion of the meeting focused on preparations for the 2025 Florida State Convention, which will be held October 3–5 at the Hilton Altamonte Springs. Members were reminded that rooms are available and can be booked through the dates of October 2–7 at the convention rate of $139 per night plus tax and a $3 tourism fee per night, with a reservation deadline of September 3\. Registration for the state convention is $25, and banquet tickets are $75, with meal options including chicken, beef, or vegetarian. Resources such as a transportation guide are already available, with a restaurant guide forthcoming. A sponsorship application for members seeking financial assistance to attend will be released soon. Members also discussed hosting a chapter social during the convention, settling on a casual pizza gathering, with potential locations being the hospitality suite, a private room, or the hotel

 pool area; final arrangements to be determined after a site visit later in July. The meeting concluded at 9:13 PM.

# **8:56 PM Statewide Social at State Convention**

	We discussed several options for the Statewide social at the state convention. It was clear that the membership wanted to have a hotel social. We then discussed several options for what we could do at the social, and it was discussed to have Pizza as our food option. We then talked about where we can have the social. Some of the options included in the sleeping area of the hospitality suite, and a person’s room. If we were to use a person’s room, we would meet at the agenda-published social location, then decide on the room. Finally, the idea of having a pool-side social was discussed. The members visiting the hotel at the end of July will explore that possibility. All in all, we will have a social with pizza, and the true location of the social is to be determined.

# **Pledge**

	I pledge to participate actively in the effort of the National Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation; and to abide by its constitution.

# **Belief Statement**

	We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or our future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams. Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the aspirations of all blind people.
