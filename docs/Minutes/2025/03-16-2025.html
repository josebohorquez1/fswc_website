<p>8:28 PM Affiliate Announcements/ Legislative Alerts and Reminders</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Florida Senate Bill 396: Changes to voting by mail.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This bill will require people to obtain medical documentation to
be eligible to vote by mail.</p></li>
<li><p>The NFB of Florida is opposed to this bill.</p></li>
<li><p>This will create barriers for people with disabilities since
obtaining medical documentation can be time consuming, and it is not
always easy to send those documents to the right office.</p></li>
<li><p>People who live in rural areas or people who cannot access
adequate transportation are highly impacted.</p></li>
<li><p>This bill has not been introduced in the Florida house.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Reminder: Contact the Florida Attorney General and Florida
Governor regarding Section 504</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Latest News</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The lawsuit has been temporarily paused; however, the lawsuit has
not been dismissed.</p></li>
<li><p>Some states wish to consider section 504 unconstitutional due to
the added rule regarding Gender Dysphoria, while some states just wish
to remove the newly added rule.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quick Facts</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seventeen U.S. states (including Texas, Florida, Georgia, and
others) are suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
and Robert F Kennedy JR.</p></li>
<li><p>The complaint challenges the May 9, 2024, Final Rule, which adds
"gender dysphoria" to the definition of "disability" under Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA).</p></li>
<li><p>Section 504 states that "No otherwise qualified individual with a
disability in the United States … shall, solely by reason of her or his
disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits
of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity
receiving Federal financial assistance".</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Refer to previously sent emails to get the Attorney general and
the governor’s contact info.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Senate Bill 1050 and house bill 1103: Consolidating Blind
Agencies into one Agency for People with Disabilities</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introduced by Jennefer Bradley-R, district 8 in the Florida
senate, and Jennifer Kincart-Johnson-R, district 49 of the Florida
House</p></li>
<li><p>This bill will consolidate all disability services into the
Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD).</p></li>
<li><p>The National Federation of the Blind is firmly apposed to any
consolidation of blind services into one general disability services
agency.</p></li>
<li><p>No other house or senate members have signed onto this bill as of
writing the agenda.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact your Florida Senate member and Florida house member to
demonstrate your opposition. Template can be found in emails sent by our
affiliate president.</p></li>
<li><p>Call specific offices to get email addresses. This is especially
if you are going to send the resolution with your letter.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<blockquote>
<p>8:50 PM Scholarship Reminders and National Convention Registration
Announcement</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Kenneth Jernigan Scholarship:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Application or letter, including affiliate presidential interview
due April 15<sup>th</sup>.</p></li>
<li><p>Will need the following info: basic contact info, state affiliate
and chapter information, mentor information (anyone on the Florida
Statewide Chapter board or affiliate can be your mentor, just ask), and
the amount of funding needed. There are also five essay questions, with
the last one being optional.</p></li>
<li><p>Can be blind or sighted.</p></li>
<li><p>While the expectations of the award are not explicitly mentioned,
expect the funding to have some strings attached, like attending Rookie
Roundup, having to attend specific convention sessions, and possibly
having to write a reflection.</p></li>
<li><p>Notification of award: May 15<sup>th</sup>. If no communication
or notice is received by that date, you were not selected for an
award.</p></li>
<li><p>Important tasks to complete after submission of application:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Book your hotel room. If you don’t win, you can cancel
immediately with half of your deposit. If a roommate is booking for you,
no action is required. Don’t wait too long, rooms will start to run out
fast, probably by late May.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a roommate. Having two or three other roommates can do
wonders to the hotel cost. Just imagine four roommates of KJ scholarship
recipients? Hint, hint!</p></li>
<li><p>Notify the affiliate president, chapter president, and mentor
that you submitted an application. These people may be contacted to
learn more about you.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not book your flight unless you are notified of an award. In
most cases, canceling a flight does not result in a refund but in a
refund of travel credit.</p></li>
<li><p>Form a rough budget for yourself. This includes roundtrip flight
cost, possible rideshare cost to and from the airport (15 miles, $20-$30
each way), hotel cost ($119 (double) or $129 (triples and quads) with
18.2% taxes and fees with $3 nightly occupancy fee), two or three meals
per day (cost will vary), $25 convention registration, and $80
banquet.</p></li>
<li><p>The website mentioned that if you cannot cover these costs, and
if you win an award, you should talk to the affiliate treasurer to form
a payment plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Convention Registration</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Registration for convention is now open. Head to
nfb.org/convention to register.</p></li>
<li><p>Registration is $25 and banquet is $80.</p></li>
<li><p>Dates: July 8<sup>th</sup> to July 13th</p></li>
<li><p>Hotel info:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Main hotel: New Orleans Marriott - 555 Canal St, New Orleans, LA
70130</p></li>
<li><p>Overflow Hotel/ Exhibit Hall Hotel: Sheraton New Orleans - 500
Canal St, New Orleans, LA 70130</p></li>
<li><p>Prices: $119 for doubles and $129 for triples and quads. Expect
combined sells tax and tourism support rate of 18.2%, and $3 nightly
occupancy fee.</p></li>
<li><p>Total nightly cost: Based on rough math, the cost per night for
doubles should be $141.28 and triples and quads should be $152.90. These
are just rough estimates.</p></li>
<li><p>An initial deposit of the first night’s cost is required upon
booking.</p></li>
<li><p>If a reservation is cancelled before Sunday, June 1, 2025, half
of the deposit will be returned. Otherwise, refunds will not be
made.</p></li>
<li><p>Reserve your room by calling 888-238-2427 for the Marriott or
888-827-7033 for the Sheraton New Orleans. Ask for the “National
Federation of the Blind 2025 Convention” block.</p></li>

<p>9:22 PM: Fundraising Plans</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Donation Drive—</p></li>
</ul>
<p>we are launching the Statewide Giving Challenge! This is our chance
to come together, rally support, and make a meaningful impact.</p>
<p>How Does the Statewide Giving Challenge Work?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is simple! We are asking all of you—our members and
supporters—to help raise funds by reaching out to your networks. You can
participate in several ways:</p></li>
<li><p>✅ Ask your friends and family to donate, then send the
contributions to Statewide.</p></li>
<li><p>✅ Create a Facebook fundraiser or use another donation platform
of your choice and direct the proceeds to Statewide.</p></li>
<li><p>✅ Request donation from a business, nonprofit, or other
organization. If requesting donations from a business, nonprofit, or
other organization, please contact our president, Z’Leah Liburd, for
approval to ensure alignment with our mission.</p></li>
<li><p>✅ Make a personal contribution if you are financially able.
Every dollar counts!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There will be an incentive of a $100 Amazon gift card to the one who
raises the most funds!</p>
<p>9:27 PM. Adjournment</p>
<p>Jose motions to adjourn the meeting; Justin seconds; all were in
favor. The meeting ended at 9:27 PM.</p>
<p>Have any questions? Email the secretary at <a
href="mailto:statewide@nfbflorida.org">statewide@nfbflorida.org</a>.</p>
<p>Pledge</p>
<p>I pledge to participate actively in the effort of the National
Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security
for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation;
and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p>Belief Statement</p>
<p>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or
our future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because
low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams.
Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the
aspirations of all blind people.</p>
