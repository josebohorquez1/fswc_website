<p>The starting balance for the month of August was $2269.69. A
withdrawal of $10 was taken for the Pac plan. A withdrawal of $148 was
made due to accounts error and sent to the Florida Association of Blind

national convention. Another withdraw of $100 was made to donate to the
hospitality suite. A deposit of $10 was made for new member dues. The
closing balance was $1867.69.</p>
<p>Jose motions to accept the treasurers report; Gathary seconds; all
were in favor.</p>
<p>8:12 PM Pledging to the affiliate</p>
<p>A discussion was held to determine how much money to pledge to the
affiliate. Scott reminded us that we were already making a pledge of
$120. Jerilyn remarks that we must fundraise more. The discussion then
turned into a discussion of selling pretzels. It was determined that we
will be selling two bundles of pretzels for $5 to rid ourselves of the
pretzels. It was agreed to continue pledging the same amount of $120. No
motion was necessary.</p>
<p>8:10 PM secretary’s report</p>
<p>The report for the month of August was emailed to the entire
membership. Jerilyn motions to accept the secretary’s report as emailed;
Scott seconds; all were in favor.</p>

<p>Z’leah reminds the assembled membership that convention is right
around the corner. Doug reminds and encourages everyone to register and
that the last date to get a banquet ticket is October 1<sup>st</sup>. He
also remarks that the price for registering will increase to $30 after
October 1<sup>st</sup> and can only be paid at the door. We then discuss
volunteering for the Florida statewide table. Gathary, her father,
Natalie, Jerilyn, and Niklas put their names up to volunteer. Concrete
volunteers were not establish. The board will work to establish concrete
volunteers.</p>
<p>8:23 PM Basket Committee report</p>
<p>This years Florida Statewide basket will be a entertainment basket.
Items like popcorn, wine, candy, and other entertainment-related goodies
will be in the basket. For door prizes, there will be five envelopes of
$20.</p>

<p>The social at the state convention was discussed. The social will be
on Saturday at 5:00 PM in the Tug room. It was determined to have a meet
and mingle social since food cannot be brought to the meeting
spaces.</p>
<p>8:32 PM Voting Presentation - Mickey Caster</p>
<p>Mickey is part of the league of women voters. The league has been
active since 1920. The core goal is to provide nonpartisan voting
education. In their presentation, Mickey discusses the six new
amendments schedule to be on the ballot. Four out the six amendments
were brought up by the legislature and two were citizen-written
amendments. Below is a summary of the amendments.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first amendment will make the schoolboard partisan. Future
candidates must announce their party affiliation. In addition, this
amendment will make schoolboard elections a closed-primary election.
Closed-primary means that you must either be registered either as a
democrat or republican. If approved, this amendment will take effect
during the 2026 schoolboard election.</p></li>
<li><p>The second amendment will enshrine a public right to fish and
hunt in the state constitution. Hunting and fishing will be the primary
way of responsibly managing wildlife in Florida.</p></li>
<li><p>The third amendment will make Marijuana legal for recreational
use in the state of Florida. People must be 21 to purchase marijuana. It
will still be illegal to use marijuana in federal lands or
federally-funded facilities, like colleges.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth amendment will limit government interference regarding
abortion. No law shall prohibit, penalize, or limit abortion before
viability, or if the life of the mother is at risk. This does not change
the constitutional provision that states that parents and guardians will
be informed of any procedure before it takes place. However, parental
consent is not required. Viability refers to when a fetus can sustain
itself outside the womb.</p></li>
<li><p>The amendment would provide for an annual inflation adjustment
for the value of the homestead property tax exemption that applies to
non-school taxes. A yes vote supports an annual inflation adjustment to
the amount of assessed value that is exempt from property
taxation.</p></li>
<li><p>The sixth amendment will repeal public campaign financing. A yes
vote supports repealing the state constitutional provision that provides
for public financing of campaigns for those running for elective
statewide office who agree to campaign spending limits.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>9:09 PM Adjournment</p>
<p>Jerilyn motions to adjourn the meeting; scott seconds; all were in
favor.</p>
<p>The meeting ended at 9:09 PM.</p>
<p>Pledge</p>
<p>I pledge to participate actively in the effort of the National
Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security
for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation;
and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p>Belief Statement:</p>
<p>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or
our future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because
low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams.
Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the
aspirations of all blind people.</p>
