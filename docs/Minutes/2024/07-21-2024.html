favor.</p>
<p>8:18 PM Treasurers Report</p>
<p>The starting balance for the month of June was $2519.43. A withdrawal
of $10 was made for the monthly PAC plan. A withdrawal of $870 was made
to pay for the pretzels for the Pretzel fundraiser. A deposit of $75 was
made since the cost of the pretzels were less. A deposit of $20 was made
as the result of two members paying dues. The ending balance for the
month of June was $1734.43. Justin motions to accept the treasurer’s
report; Gathary seconds; all were in favor.</p>
<p>8:20 PM Discussing the National Convention:</p>
<p>Many members attended the national convention and one member attended
virtually. Z’Leah asks the assembled participants to discuss their
convention experiences.</p>
<p>Gathary: She attended the convention for a few days in person and
attended the remainder of the convention virtually. One of her
highlights was attending a meeting discussing braille. In that meeting,
she learned more about the Braille Authority of North America and
learned more about braille in other languages.</p>
<p>Sarah: This was her first national convention. Her highlight was
attending the National Organization of Parents of Blind Children (NOPBC)
conference. She enjoyed meeting other parents and learning about
resources for her son.</p>
<p>Maggie: This was her fourth convention. She attended the convention
with a relative from North Carolina. She enjoyed listening to the North
Carolina Caucus, and she reported that many attendees had positive
feedback for the hotel and hotel staff.</p>
<p>Carilyn: She remarked that her experience went well. She was
surprised about the locations for the upcoming national conventions. She
also commented that the seats in the ballrooms were not comfortable.</p>
<p>Scott: He enjoyed attending the Florida Caucus. He also commented
that the exhibit hall was big and confusing, regardless, he enjoyed the
venue. He also noted the high amount of walking throughout the
conference.</p>
<p>Justin: He attended the national convention virtually. He reported
that there was more engagement in the virtual component. Unfortunately,
he informed the assembled body of a technical issue that occurred at the
end of one of the general sessions. His highlight was learning about the
Hims new braille display, the Braille Emotion. Justin hopes that the
braille emotion can compete well against other existing braille displays
in the market.</p>
<p>8:30 PM Discussing the Pretzel Fundraiser</p>
<p>Treasurer Scott informed the general body that we sold one case of
pretzel or 240 pretzels. He remarked that the fundraiser did not go well
as he would have hoped. He also remarked that the location of the table
was one major hindrance.</p>
<p>8:36 PM Basket Committee</p>
<p>It was discussed to have Justin and Jose as the cochairs of the
committee. We will revisit the topic again in the next meeting.</p>
<p>8:41 PM National Convention Refunds</p>
<p>Affiliate treasurer Sylvia is currently on vacation. We will get more
updates about the refunds once her vacation is over.</p>
<p>Adjournment</p>
<p>Jose motioned to adjourn the meeting; Scott seconds; all were in
favor. The meeting ended at 8:44 PM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pledge</p>
<p>I pledge to participate actively in the effort of the National
Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security
for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation;
and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p>Belief Statement</p>
<p>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or
our future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because
low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams.
Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the
aspirations of all blind people.</p>
