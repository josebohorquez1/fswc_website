<p>8:14 PM: Making a new motion for the pretzels budget.</p>
<p>Based on five cases and an ice fee, it was revealed that the total
price for the pretzels was $870. We discuss whether selling 4 pretzels
for $5 would be profitable considering that we will have to apply taxes.
One idea that was brought up was to sell them for $6. Jose then remarks
that selling for $6 would sound less enticing than just selling them for
$5. Jerilyn asks whether we can just sell 3 flavors only which will
allow us to still sell pretzels for $5 and make more of a profit. We
then started discussing a budget. Cammille then advised us to pick a
greater budget than the actual cost to prevent budget shortfalls. A
budget of $950 was considered and chosen. Jerilyn motions to amend the
original motion and motions to set aside a budget of $950 for the
purchase of pretzels; Jose Seconds; all were in favor.</p>
<p>8:24 PM: Reimbursement Opportunity Reminder</p>
<p>It is not late to send the president of the statewide chapter an
email with your proof of registration and telling us where you would
like to volunteer at the convention. In addition, to receive the
reimbursement, the board would like the recipients to assist with the
selling of pretzels and assist with the exhibit table if possible.
Anyone who is a statewide chapter member who sends an email with their
proof of registration will receive $25 after convention to cover their
registration cost. All you have to do is send an email to <a
href="mailto:nfbf.statewide@gmail.com">nfbf.statewide@gmail.com</a> with
the above requirements.</p>
<p>8:28 PM: Volunteering at convention</p>
<p>It was discussed to create a group chat to keep in touch with the
chapter members going to the convention. Z’leah reveals the volunteer
opportunities that the board has selected for the convention. The times
will be sent out via email once they are finalized.</p>
<p>8:29 PM Affiliate Announcement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Camille announces a major change to the affiliate fundraiser. Instead
of a cruise, the fundraiser will now be a raffle with the chance for the
winner to win a trip for two for a four or five night stay at an
all-inclusive resort in either Los Cabos or Puerta Vallarta, Mexico. If
you are the winner of this wonderful package, the affiliate will share
your contact info with the vacation package company, then the company
will contact you. You have a year to book your resort stay, and another
year to go to the resort. The winner will receive a $500 visa gift card
to be used at the winner’s discretion. The card can be used for any
transaction, including the flight. The affiliate treasurer Sylvia Young
will be sending tickets to chapter presidents for members to sell them
to the public. You do not have to be present at the convention to buy a
ticket. The value of the trip, along with the visa gift card, is $1495.
This fundraiser should not be announced through social media to stay
within the bounds of Florida law. If you have any questions about the
fundraiser, ask a member of the affiliate board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the fundraiser, Camille announces the National
Convention concert. The concert will take place on July 4<sup>th</sup>
from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM. Wristbands will be sold for $10. For more
information, refer to the convention agenda.</p>
<p>President Hernandez announces the date and time for the annual
Florida Caucus at the convention. The caucus will take place on July
5<sup>th</sup> from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM. Topics including resolutions and
other related convention topics will be discussed. This caucus is
important to attend since the caucus will be the place where we, as an
affiliate, will take positions on the various resolutions on the floor.
The caucus will take place at Salon 2 at the Rosen Center, and there
will be no zoom recording.</p>
<p>Finally, it is announced that the National Convention agenda is out.
You can find the HTML, and other versions of the agenda at
nfb.org/convention.</p>
<p>8:55 PM: Adjournment</p>
<p>Justin motions to adjourn the meeting; Valerie seconds; all were in
favor. The meeting ends at 8:56 PM.</p>
<p>Pledge</p>
<p>I pledge to participate actively in the effort of the National
Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security
for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation;
and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p>Belief Statement</p>
<p>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or
our future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because
low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams.
Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the
aspirations of all blind people.</p>
