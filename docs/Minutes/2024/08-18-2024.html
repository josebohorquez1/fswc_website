<p>8:23 PM Presentation on Tactile Training by Brandon Piane</p>
<p>Mr. Piane is currently based in the city of Philadelphia
Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree
in exercise science. In his presentation, Mr. Piane told the story of
Viky, his first blind client. Because of Viky, he believed that people
with disabilities can do anything. Mr. Piane had a variety of careers
stints. According to his remarks, he worked in a rehab clinic for two
years; he also worked with corporate wellness with the Comcast company.
During his time with the comcast company, he met Tom, the person who
would be his first blind client. Mr. Piane still works with Tom to this
day. During the covid-19 pandemic, through the struggles of Tom and
others, Mr. Piane notice the lack of resources for the blind community,
especially in the area of health and wellness. For these reasons, Mr.
Piane launched Tactile training, a newsletter with audio-described
exercise content for the blind. In his weekly Friday newsletters, Mr.
Piane discusses topics like exercising, extrinsic and intrinsic
motivation as it relates to wellness, and more. During the remainder of
his presentation, Mr. Piane asked for the feedback of the assembled
participants regarding what he can cover in his newsletter. He ended his
presentation by noted that the content of his newsletter can be done by
anyone and does not require equipment. A link to his newsletter was sent
via the statewide list serve.</p>

and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p>Belief Statement:</p>
<p>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or
our future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because
low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams.
Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the
aspirations of all blind people.</p>
