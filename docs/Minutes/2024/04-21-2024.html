<p>Florida Statewide Monthly Business Meeting Minutes</p>
<p>Date: 04/21/2024</p>
<p>Meeting was called to order at 8:07 PM</p>
<p>8:07 PM Role Call</p>
<p>Three members of the board were present; President Liburd was not
present during role call but attended later. A quorum was
established.</p>
<p>8:10 PM Pledge</p>
<p>The pledge was recited by Gafri McKinley.</p>
<p>8:12 PM Treasurers report</p>
<p>For march, the starting balance was $2573.55. The monthly
contribution of $10 to the NFB PAC plan was withdrawn. The closing
balance for the month was $2554.55. The treasurer announced the new
PayPal Account and stated that they will send the link to the statewide
list serve. Jose motioned to accept the treasurer’s report; Gafri
seconds; all were in favor.</p>
<p>8:17 PM Secretary’s report</p>
<p>The secretary reported that the minutes were emailed. Gafri remarked
that the one-minute message may have had an error. The secretary stated
that they would check the NFB website and make corrections for next
month’s minutes. Peggy motioned to accept the secretary’s report as
emailed; Justin seconds; all were in favor.</p>
<p>8:22 PM Reminder about national and state conventions</p>
<p>National convention will be from July 3<sup>rd</sup> to the
8<sup>th</sup>. For more info, visit nfb.org/convention</p>
<p>Justin and Peggy reported on the state convention planning meeting.
Justin reported that the committee was asking participants of possible
ideas for seminars to have at the state convention. Peggy took the
opportunity to discuss the Florida information table at national
convention and has requested people to volunteer for two-hour blocks,
and the information on volunteering will be sent out soon.</p>
<p>Camille reported on national convention. They discussed our
responsibility as the hosting affiliate. Responsibilities include
opening ceremonies, hosting a musical concert on a date during
convention that is to be determined, and hosting an exhibit hall and
information table. The music concert will be Florida-themed. They
announced the affiliate fundraiser which was a $20 per-person raffle
where participants could win a 2-person cruise through Royal Caribbean,
and they can choose from a three-night cruise around the Caribbean, or a
four-night cruise to Bermuda. The winner will get a balcony stateroom,
and they can board from Bayonne NJ (only from May to October), Port
Canaveral FL, Miami Fl, Tampa FL, and Galveston TX. Airfare is not
included; however, the winner will receive a $500 gift card that can be
used at their discretion and even outside of the cruise. Tickets will be
printed out and will be sent to each chapter and division president to
be given to members to help fundraise. The raffle will not be on social
media, and online payment methods will not exist to stay within the
bounds of Florida law. The tickets can be sold from upon being received
up to the last day of national convention. Customers must visit a room
set aside for raffles on the last day of convention where the winning
ticket will be announced. The contact info of the customer must be
properly printed on the stub that will be turned into the affiliate. If
the customer requests an online payment option, the affiliate asks that
the customer pays the money to the seller using an agreed-upon online
option, then the seller withdraws the money from their bank account and
include it with the cash being raised. The money must be turned into the
affiliate.</p>
<p>Justin then asks to make an announcement regarding accommodations on
Flix Bus and Greyhound. It was discussed that calling the greyhound and
flix customer service to request accommodations is recommended. Camille
recommends to pay extra for a front seat since you are required to sit
on assigned seats anyway. Jose commented that drivers tend to allow you
to sit on row 1 and that those seats are not on the seat reservation
page. Camille then warned that many Greyhound and Flix stops do not have
traditional bus stops and instead tend to be signs in the middle of
parking lots, and in addition, most stops are not owned and operated by
Greyhound and Flix.</p>
<p>8:53 PM Who is interested in going to convention?</p>
<p>Jose, Peggy, Brittany, Scott, Camille are going to convention. Justin
will attend virtually. Camille stated that the virtual component of
convention will cost $10.</p>
<p>9:01 PM Hospitality Suite</p>
<p>We discussed donating to the hospitality suite. Jose suggests we
donate an amount between $65-$100. Peggy says to donate $100. Peggy
motions that $100 be donated to the hospitality suite, Jose seconds; all
were in favor.</p>
<p>9:04 PM Fundraising at national convention</p>
<p>Brittany reports on pretzels. Each pretzel is candy-coated in flavors
like salted-caramel, rainbow sprinkle, chocolate bits, and crunchy
toffee. A customer would get one set of pretzels of each flavor for $5.
One master case has 240 pretzels, costing $144. It will be delivered
within one week. Brittany suggested to buy five master cases. One member
suggested that five was too many, but others remarked that convention
will have up to 3000 attendees. One member commented that there may not
be enough volunteers, it was commented that there are five days to sell
all the pretzels. Jerrilyn motions to buy five pretzels to sell at
convention, Peggy seconds; all were in favor.</p>
<p>Justin reports on the fans. Each fan will be made of athletic gold
colored carboard paper and will have the NFB of Florida logo on them.
The fans would be shaped into a seashell. It will cost $168 for 300
fans. It takes up to two weeks to be deliver. Discussion occurred to see
if the fans should be sold with the pretzels or not. Paul then stated
that the fans may not sell well since there are a souvenir item and no
one will want to pay for them. The membership then agreed. The fans idea
was tabled.</p>
<p>9:25 PM Adjournment</p>
<p>Justin motions to adjourn the meeting; Peggy seconds; all were in
favor.</p>
<p>Pledge</p>
<p>I pledge to participate actively in the effort of the National
Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security
for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation;
and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p>One Minute Message Updated from Jan 2021</p>
<p>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or
our future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because
low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams.
Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the
aspirations of all blind people.</p>
