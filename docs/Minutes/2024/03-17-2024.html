<p>Florida Statewide Monthly Minutes</p>
<p>03/17/2024</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meeting was called to order at 8:04 PM by President Z’leah Liburd</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pledge and one minute message was skipped to make time for the
Menus4ALL presentation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>8:05 PM Role call by president Z’leah Liburd</p>
<p>All members of the board were present</p>
<p>Nineteen other attendees were also present</p>
<p> </p>
<p>8:07 PM Secretary’s report</p>
<p>Minutes from last month’s meeting were emailed by the last outgoing
secretary to the Florida Statewide Listserve.</p>

<p>Peggy motions the secretary’s report that was emailed; Justin
seconds; all were in favor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>8:09 PM Menus4ALL presentation</p>
<p>Menus4ALL started out as a website in 2018 with just five-thousand
menus. With feedback, the website would be turned into an IOS app with
over one-million menus available. The app’s functionality is to turn a
dataset of menus into a format that is accessible to the visually
impaired. Voice gestures can be used to read the menus. All IOS
customizations, like inverted colors, and voice control, work as
expected on the app. All menus are structured the same for consistency.
Each menu has information about the restaurant’s location, hours of
operation, phone information, and food items, which are organized into
distinct categories. Each distinct category shows the food items, along
with a brief description of the food item and price if available. In
addition, each category has a price range label that shows the price
range of all the food items within that category. Features include: a
near me tab which shows restaurants within your current location within
a 20-mile radius, a search tab that allows you to search restaurants by
name, particular food item, or location; results are shown within 20
miles of your location or the specified location; the radius can be
extended, and a waiter light which allows you to activate a light that
servers can seen if your device is held above your head. Each menu can
be bookmarked for later viewing. Tutorials are available for each
feature of the app on the Menus4ALL website. Menus4ALL is a
subscription-based app; $2.99 monthly, or $29.99 annually; apple taxes
and fees are an addition to the price; subscription can be canceled by
the subscriptions page within AppleID settings within settings; a
two-week trial is available for the monthly and annual subscription
before you pay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>8:42 PM Treasurer’s report</p>
<p>The opening balance was $2453.99. Ten dollars was taken for the
monthly PAC contribution. A ten dollar deposit was added to our account.
Another deposit for dues was made for $56.84, additional $50 refund was
accredited to our account from the affiliate. An addition, more dues of
$9.81 was deposited to the account. The ending balance for the month was
2574.55. Justin motions the treasurer’s report; Yassir seconds; all were
in favor. It was also noted that we don’t currently have a PayPal; one
will be created soon.</p>

<p>8:45 PM State and National Convention</p>
<p>The state convention open planning committee meeting meets every
fourth Wednesday. President Liburd requests for a volunteer to serve as
the representative for the statewide chapter; Peggy volunteers since she
is the chair for the state convention planning committee.</p>
<p>The national convention open planning committee meets every second
Sunday of the month. President Liburd has volunteered herself to be the
florida statewide representative for this meeting.</p>
<p>Duties include: reporting on the tasks that statewide members must
perform during both conventions; bringing up ideas from the members to
the respective planning committee, and report on each meeting to the
statewide members.</p>

<p>8:54 PM Fundraising ideas</p>

<p> </p>
<p>NFB Pledge</p>
<p>I pledge to participate actively in the effort of the National
Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security
for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation;
and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p>One Minute Message:</p>
<p>The National Federation of the Blind knows that blindness is not the
characteristic that defines you or your future. Every day we raise the
expectations of blind people, because low expectations create obstacles
between blind people and our dreams. You can have the life you want;
blindness is not what holds you back.</p>
