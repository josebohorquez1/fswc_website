<p>8:10 PM Announcing the new membership form</p>
<p>President Liburd announces the membership form. Any prospective
member can fill out the form through Google Forms. If any one needs
assistance, or if corrections need to be made, then any member of the
board can be contacted to assist. Gathari asks where to find the form.
President Liburd responded by saying that the form is usually emailed to
prospective members, but we will find a way to make the form more
readily available.</p>
<p>8:16 PM convention reimbursement announcement</p>
<p>Any member of the Florida Statewide chapter can be reimbursed $25
from their convention registration fee if they help with the pretzel
fundraiser at national convention, in addition to either volunteering at
the Florida Information Table or at the Hospitality Suite. Members must
assist at the exhibit hall table during our allotted time slot. We need
continuous assistance in selling pretzels throughout the convention– a
simple yet impactful way to support your chapter's initiatives. Whether
it be during the breaks in general session, in the exhibit hall, or
anywhere not during important sessions, we ask the members requesting
reimbursement to help fundraise for the chapter. Members will be given
sets of pretzels to sell to the public to be sold at $5. The proceeds
must then be given to the treasurer. Any questions should be directed to
the president at <a
href="mailto:nfbf.statewide@gmail.com">nfbf.statewide@gmail.com</a>. To
receive reimbursement, send your proof of registration, along with your
prefer volunteering opportunity, to our president at <a
href="mailto:nfbf.statewide@gmail.com">nfbf.statewide@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>8:18 PM Affiliate announcement</p>
<p>Camille reminded the members of the affiliate cruise fundraiser
happening during the national convention. The affiliate fundraiser is a
$20 per-person raffle where participants could win a 2-person cruise
through Royal Caribbean, and they can choose from a three-night cruise
around the Caribbean, or a four-night cruise to Bermuda. The winner will
get a balcony stateroom, and they can board from Bayonne NJ (only from
May to October), Port Canaveral FL, Miami Fl, Tampa FL, and Galveston
TX. Airfare is not included; however, the winner will receive a $500
gift card that can be used at their discretion and even outside of the
cruise. Tickets will be printed out and will be sent to each chapter and
division president to be given to members to help fundraise. The raffle
will not be on social media, and online payment methods will not exist
to stay within the bounds of Florida law. The tickets can be sold from
upon being received up to the last day of national convention. Customers
must visit a room set aside for raffles on the last day of convention
where the winning ticket will be announced. The contact info of the
customer must be properly printed on the stub that will be turned into
the affiliate. If the customer requests an online payment option, the
affiliate asks that the customer pays the money to the seller using an
agreed-upon online option, then the seller withdraws the money from
their bank account and include it with the cash being raised. The money
must be turned into the affiliate.</p>
<p>President Hernandez also took the opportunity to announce and discuss
the selling of products by the affiliate and associated chapters and
divisions. He announced the creation of a new form that must be filled
out before selling a product at the national convention. He remarked
that the affiliate must be aware of all products being sold by each
chapter and division in order to accurately pay taxes on the earnings.
The amount fundraised from the selling of products must be reported to
the IRS and the Florida department of revenue. As for raffles, they do
not have to be reported since they are not tangible products, and taxes
will not be collected. Presidents call will be announced soon where we
learn more about the form and other key info. He also remarked that you
do not have to be present for the cruise drawing, and you can still pay
for a ticket outside of convention.</p>
<p>8:28 PM Voting in New members</p>
<p>President Liburd announces that we have new members to vote in. The
new members were Sarah Stolarczyk, Rosalyn Kennedy, and Valerie
Núñez-Caicedo. President Liburd reads the onboarding NFB new member
message. They each introduce themselves, and share what color they
believe themselves to be. All each say yes to becoming a member of the
National Federation of the Blind. Jose motions to vote in our three new
members, gathari seconds; all were in favor. Z’leah recited the pledge
and the new members repeated after her. The members were then considered
full-fledge members of the chapter, and the National Federation of the
Blind.</p>
<p>9:00 PM Adjournment</p>
<p>Jose motions to adjourn the meeting, gathari seconds; all were in
favor.</p>
<p>Pledge</p>
<p>I pledge to participate actively in the effort of the National
Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security
for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the Federation;
and to abide by its constitution.</p>
<p>One Minute Message Updated from Jan 2021</p>
<p>We know that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or
our future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because
low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams.
Our collective power, determination, and diversity achieve the
aspirations of all blind people.</p>
