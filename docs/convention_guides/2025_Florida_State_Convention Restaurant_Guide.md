# **Introduction**

Conventions can be a blast: fun, exciting, and sometimes a little chaotic. But after all that excitement, one thing's for sure: you're going to get hungry. So the question becomes, what do you want to eat? Are you in the mood for something quick from a hotel restaurant? Looking for something more affordable? Craving a juicy burger or maybe something more authentic and local? This guide is here to help you answer all those questions and more. Inside, you’ll find details on a variety of restaurants within 3 miles of the hotel. We've also included a special section called “What the Locals Eat,” which highlights some of our favorite local spots within a ten-mile radius. If you're looking for real local flavor, that's the place to start. Each listing includes the restaurant’s hours, a brief description, a menu link (if available), and other helpful information. This is not means an exhaustive list of restaurants within 3 miles from the hotel, but we hope that these listings can help fill you right up. Our goal is to make it easy for you to find your next great meal while you're in Altamonte Springs. So with that said, let’s dig in\!
